I keep it realer than most I know your feelin it
Cristal on ice I like to toast I keep on spillin it
Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this
On my back the fliest clothes lookin ill and shit
Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch
And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but
Makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circular success they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas wit some shit that a light they life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall cause everyone would be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it
Jiggy jigger lookin gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talkin 'bout large money what's the point?
