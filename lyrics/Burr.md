Alexander joins forces with James Madison 
and John Jay to write a series of essays 
defending the new United States Constitution, 
entitled The Federalist Papers.
The plan was to write a total of twenty-five 
essays, the work divided evenly among the 
three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five 
essays, in the span of six months. John Jay 
got sick after writing five. James Madison 
wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other 
fifty-one.
