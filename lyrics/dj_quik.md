And now I'm out of the tub up in a fancy freak
Spray on some serious and put on my Girbaud jeans
Sweatsuit, the gray one with the burgundy trim
And it's a medium, fit me proper cause I'm nice and slim
Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin
And I am steadily thinkin about the 8 that I'll be drinkin
