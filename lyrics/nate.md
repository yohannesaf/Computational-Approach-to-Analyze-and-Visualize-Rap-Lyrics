I believe I got to see
We been making music since we were kids
Its all I want to do, for life
Keeping it real until the day I die
I stay funkish in my way
Continue to mash and don't forget to pray
I keep my hand on my steel
Because I love my life and I always will
Whatever people say to me
I take it in stride I'm thinking negro league
If you really don't know me
Then you best back up, I suggest strongly
They started this DPG
Until the day I D-I-E
For my L-I-F and E
No matter where I look that's all I see
And I know
