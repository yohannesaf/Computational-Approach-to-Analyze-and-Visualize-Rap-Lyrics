Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson don't ask for your favorite rapper
I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy
I assassin my casualty and it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to be 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me and y'all luck, just ran out you'll see
