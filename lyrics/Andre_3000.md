Throwing things, yelling in a mad high pitch
Here we go again with this psychopath bitch
The neighbors will hear you, you misfit
Can't disagree with the bitch without this shit
The price we pay to fuck women
The most pretty bitch got the psycho shit within them
Stuck up, as soon as I pop up
But see me with the next she wanna tear the fucking club up
Check her pants, and number confirming
Learned more and more they're just shifty dumb vermins
And you know, probably get cussed if I backslip miss
while she busy trying to justify who cheated first
"Rick what would I want
with this small chain wearin muh-fucka trying to front?"
I oughta cut her off, let another sooth me
but I don't know, ordinary bitch don't move me
I mean, I tried to fall in love with a bittie
but straight up, just be with the bitch out of pity
So although I know, pretty bitch shady
Here I go, trying to change a hoe into a lady
Knahmean?
