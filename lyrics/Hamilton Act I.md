AARON BURR
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore 
and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a 
forgotten 
spot in the Caribbean by providence, 
impoverished, in squalor,
grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

JOHN LAURENS
The ten-dollar founding father without a 
father
got a lot farther by working a lot harder,
by being a lot smarter,
by being a self-starter,
by fourteen, they placed him in charge of a 
trading charter.

THOMAS JEFFERSON
And every day while slaves were being 
slaughtered and carted
away across the waves, he struggled and kept 
his guard up.
Inside, he was longing for something to be 
a part of,
the brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow 
or barter.

JAMES MADISON
Then a hurricane came, and devastation 
reigned,
our man saw his future drip, dripping down 
the drain,
put a pencil to his temple, connected it to 
his brain,
and he wrote his first refrain, a testament 
to his pain.

BURR
Well, the word got around, they said, “This 
kid is insane, man”
took up a collection just to send him to the 
mainland.

“Get your education, don’t forget from whence 
you came, and
the world is gonna know your name. What’s 
your name, man?”

ALEXANDER HAMILTON
Alexander Hamilton.
My name is Alexander Hamilton.
And there’s a million things I haven’t done,
but just you wait, just you wait . . .

ELIZA HAMILTON
When he was ten his father split, full of it, 
debt-ridden,
two years later, see Alex and his mother 
bed-ridden,
half-dead sittin in their own sick,
the scent thick,

COMPANY
And Alex got better but his mother went quick.

GEORGE 
WASHINGTON
Moved in with a 
cousin, the cousin 
committed suicide.
Left him with nothin’ 
but ruined pride, 
something new inside,
a voice saying,

“You gotta fend for 
yourself.”

COMPANY
“Alex,

he started retreatin’ 
and readin’ every 
treatise on the shelf.

you gotta fend for 
yourself.”

BURR
There would have 
been nothin’ left 
to do

for someone less 
astute,
he woulda been dead 
or destitute
without a cent of 
restitution,
started workin’, 
clerkin’ for his late 
mother’s landlord,
tradin’ sugar cane 
and rum and all the 
things he can’t afford
scammin’ for every 
book he can get his 
hands on,

COMPANY
Scammin’

plannin’ for the 
future see him now as 
he stands on Plannin’
the bow of a ship 
headed for a new 
land,

Oooh…

In New York you can 
be a new man.

2. AARON BURR, SIR

COMPANY
1776. New York City.  

HAMILTON
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

BURR
That depends. Who’s asking?

HAMILTON
Oh, well, sure, sir,
I’m Alexander Hamilton, I’m at your service, 
sir.
I have been looking for you.

BURR
I’m getting nervous.

HAMILTON
Sir…
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking 
an accelerated course of study when I got sort 
of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may 
have punched him. It’s a blur, sir. He handles 
the financials?

BURR
You punched the bursar.

HAMILTON
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, 
then join the revolution. He looked at me like I 
was stupid, I’m not stupid.

So how’d you do it? How’d you graduate 
so fast? 

BURR 
It was my parents’ dying wish before they 
passed.

HAMILTON
You’re an orphan. Of course! I’m an orphan. 
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we’re worth more 
than anyone bargained for…

BURR
Can I buy you a drink?

HAMILTON
That would be nice.

BURR
While we’re talking, let me offer you some 
free advice. 
Talk less.

HAMILTON
What?

BURR
Smile more.

HAMILTON
Ha.

BURR
Don’t let them know what you’re against or 
what you’re for.

HAMILTON
You can’t be serious.

BURR
You wanna get ahead? 

HAMILTON
Yes. 

BURR
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead.



LAURENS
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it? 

LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN 
Show time!

BURR

LAURENS
Show time! Show time! Yo! 

I’m John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o’ Sam Adams, but I’m workin’ on 
three, uh!
Those redcoats don’t want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till 
I’m free!

LAFAYETTE
Oui oui, mon ami, je m’appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say “Bonsoir!”
Tell the King “Casse toi!” Who’s the best? 
C’est moi!

MULLIGAN
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan,
Up in it, lovin’ it, yes I heard ya mother said 

“Come again?” 
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
it’s hard to have intercourse over four sets 
of corsets…

LAURENS
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let’s raise a couple more…

LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN
To the revolution!

LAURENS
Well, if it ain’t the prodigy of Princeton 
college!

MULLIGAN
Aaron Burr!

LAURENS
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

BURR
Good luck with that: you’re takin’ a stand.
You spit. I’m ‘a sit. We’ll see where we land.

LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN
Boooo!

LAURENS
Burr, the revolution’s imminent. What do 
you stall for? 

HAMILTON
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what’ll you 
fall for?

3. MY SHOT
LAURENS MULLIGAN LAFAYETTE
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh,
Who are you?

Who are you?
Who are you?

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS
Ooh, who is this kid? What’s he gonna do?

HAMILTON
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I’m just like my country,
I’m young, scrappy and hungry,
and I’m not throwing away my shot! 
I’m ‘a get a scholarship to King’s College.
I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but dag, I amaze 
and astonish.
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish.
I gotta holler just to be heard.
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I’m a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece 
of coal

tryin’ to reach my goal. My power of speech: 
unimpeachable.
Only nineteen but my mind is older.
These New York City streets get colder, I 
shoulder
ev’ry burden, ev’ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don’t have a gun 
to brandish,
I walk these streets famished.
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame.
But damn, it’s getting dark, so let me spell 
out the name,
I am the—

HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/
LAURENS
A-l-e-x-a-n-d
e-r—we are—meant to be...

HAMILTON
A colony that runs independently.
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin’ on us 
endlessly.
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly,
then King George turns around, runs a 
spending spree.
He ain’t ever gonna set his descendants free,
so there will be a revolution in this century.
Enter me! 

LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS
(He says in parentheses)

HAMILTON
Don’t be shocked when your hist’ry book 
mentions me.
I will lay down my life if it sets us free.
Eventually, you’ll see my ascendancy,

HAMILTON LAURENS
And I am not throwing 
away my shot.

My shot!

I am not throwing 
away my shot.

My shot!

Hey yo, I’m just like 
my country,

It’s time to take a shot!

LAFAYETTE
I dream of life without a monarchy.
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?’
When I fight, I make the other side panicky.

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/
MULLIGAN
Shot!

MULLIGAN
Yo, I’m a tailor’s apprentice,
and I got y’all knuckleheads in loco parentis.
I’m joining the rebellion cuz I know it’s my 
chance
to socially advance, instead of sewin’ some 
pants!
I’m gonna take a-

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/
MULLIGAN
Shot!

LAURENS
But we’ll never be truly free
until those in bondage have the same rights 
as you and me,
you and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
on a stallion with the first black battalion

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/
MULLIGAN
Shot!

BURR
Geniuses, lower your voices.
You keep out of trouble and you double your 
choices.
I’m with you, but the situation is fraught.
You’ve got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you’re gonna get shot!

HAMILTON
Burr, check what we got.
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot,
I think your pants look hot, 
Laurens, I like you a lot.
Let’s hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin’ 
the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all 
in one spot,
poppin’ a squat on conventional wisdom, like 
it or not,
a bunch of revolutionary manumission 
abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the 
ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin’ too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at 
the mouth.
I never had a group of friends before,
I promise that I’ll make y’all proud.

I imagine death so much it feels more like 
a memory
When’s it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
 comin’, do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I’d live past twenty.
Where I come from some get half as many.
Ask anybody why we livin’ fast and we
laugh, reach for a flask,
we have to make this moment last, that’s 
plenty.

Scratch that,
this is not a moment, it’s the movement
where all the hungriest brothers with 
something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand,
we roll like Moses, claimin’ our promised land.
And? If we win our independence?

‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our 
descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
cycle of vengeance and death with no 
defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin’,
but Jesus, between all the bleedin’ ‘n fightin’ 
I’ve been readin’ ‘n writin’.
We need to handle our financial situation.
Are we a nation of states? What’s the state of 
our nation?
I’m past patiently waitin’. I’m passionately 
smashin’ every expectation,  
every action’s an act of creation!
I’m laughin’ in the face of casualties and 
sorrow,
for the first time, I’m thinkin’ past tomorrow,

HAMILTON AND COMPANY

You’ll remember you belong to me.
You’ll be back.



Time will tell.
You’ll remember that I served you well.

And no, don’t change the subject
cuz you’re my favorite subject.
My sweet, submissive subject,
my loyal, royal subject, 
forever and ever and ever and ever and ever…

You’ll be back,
like before.
I will fight the fight and win the war
for your love,
for your praise,
and I’ll love you till my dying days.
When you’re gone
I’ll go mad,
so don’t throw away this thing we had.

Cuz when push comes to shove,
I will kill your friends and family to remind 
you of my love.

HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/
LAFAYETTE
Rise up!

HAMILTON
We will fight for this land
but there’s only one man 
who can give us a command so we can-

HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/
LAFAYETTE
Rise up!

HAMILTON
Understand? It’s the only way to- 

HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/
LAFAYETTE
Rise up! Rise up!

HAMILTON
Here he comes!

ENSEMBLE
Here comes the General!

BURR
Ladies and gentlemen!

ENSEMBLE
Here comes the General!

BURR
The moment you’ve been waiting for!

ENSEMBLE
Here comes the General!

BURR
The pride of Mount Vernon!

ENSEMBLE
Here comes the general!

BURR
George Washington!

WASHINGTON ENSEMBLE
We are outgunned, What?
outmanned, What?
outnumbered, 
outplanned.

Buck, buck, buck, buck, 
buck!

We gotta make an  
all out stand 
ayo, I’m gonna need  
a right-hand man.

Buck, buck, buck, buck, 
buck!



WASHINGTON
Check it—
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I 
feel a second?
Now I’m the model of a modern major general,
the venerated Virginian veteran whose men 
are all
lining up, to put me up on a pedestal, 
writin’ letters to relatives
embellishin’ my elegance and eloquence,
but the elephant is in the room,
the truth is in ya face when ya hear the British 
cannons go...

ENSEMBLE
Boom!

WASHINGTON
Any hope of success is fleeting,
how can I keep leading when the people I’m 
leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British 
take Brooklyn,
knight takes rook, but look, 

WASHINGTON ENSEMBLE
We are outgunned, What?
outmanned, What?
outnumbered, 
outplanned. Buck, buck, buck, buck, 

buck!
We gotta make an all 
out stand 
ayo, I’m gonna need a 
right-hand man.

Incoming!

HAMILTON 
They’re battering down the Battery 
check the damages.

MULLIGAN
Rah! 

HAMILTON 
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em
of their advantages. 

MULLIGAN
Rah! 

HAMILTON 
Let’s take a stand with the stamina God has 
granted us.
Hamilton won’t abandon ship,
Yo, let’s steal their cannons-

MULLIGAN COMPANY
Shh-boom! Boom!

WASHINGTON
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit 
spray and...

COMPANY
Boom! 

WASHINGTON
Goes the cannon, we’re abandonin’ Kips 
Bay and...

COMPANY
Boom! 

WASHINGTON
There’s another ship and...

COMPANY
Boom! 

WASHINGTON
We just lost the southern tip and...

COMPANY
Boom! 

WASHINGTON
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can’t afford 
another slip.
Guns and horses giddyup,
I decide to divvy up

my forces, they’re skittish as the British cut 
the city up.
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny,
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
are these the men with which I am to defend 
America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the 
distance.
I cannot be everywhere at once, people.
I’m in dire need of assistance . . .

BURR
Your excellency, sir! 

WASHINGTON
Who are you? 

BURR
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

WASHINGTON
As you were.

BURR
Sir,
I was a captain under General Montgomery
until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec, 
and well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance.
I admire how you keep firing on the British 
from a distance.

WASHINGTON
Huh. 

BURR
I have some questions, a couple of 
suggestions
on how to fight instead of fleeing west.

WASHINGTON
Yes?

BURR
Well-



HAMILTON
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

WASHINGTON
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

HAMILTON
Yes, sir.

HAMILTON AND BURR
We keep meeting.

BURR
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing 
your strategy play out.

WASHINGTON
Burr?

BURR
Sir?

WASHINGTON
Close the door on your way out.

HAMILTON
Have I done something wrong, sir?

WASHINGTON
On the contrary.
I called you here because our odds are beyond 
scary.
Your reputation precedes you, but I have 
to laugh.

HAMILTON
Sir?

WASHINGTON
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on 
their staff?

HAMILTON
Sir!

WASHINGTON
Don’t get me wrong, you’re a young man, of 
great renown.

I know you stole British cannons when we 
were still downtown.
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to 
hire you...

HAMILTON
To be their Secretary? I don’t think so. 

WASHINGTON
Why’re you upset?

HAMILTON
I’m not—

WASHINGTON
It’s alright, you want to fight, you’ve got a 
hunger.
I was just like you when I was younger.
Head full of fantasies of dyin’ like a martyr?

HAMILTON
Yes.

WASHINGTON
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder.

HAMILTON
Why are you telling me this?

WASHINGTON
I’m being honest.
I’m working with a third of what our Congress 
has promised.
We are a powder keg about to explode,
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
Ayo, I’m just like my country, I’m young, 
scrappy and hungry!

HAMILTON 
I am not throwing away my shot! 

WASHINGTON 
Son, 

WASHINGON AND COMPANY
We are outgunned, outmanned!

HAMILTON
You need all the help you can get.
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan,
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else? 

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY
Outnumbered, outplanned!

HAMILTON
We’ll need some spies on the inside,
Some King’s men who might let some things 
slide.

HAMILTON COMPANY

I’ll write to 
Congress and

9. A WINTER’S BALL

BURR
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore, 
go on and on,
grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth 
bother
be seated at the right hand of the father.
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight,
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write. 
Now Hamilton’s skill with a quill is undeniable

But what do we have in common? We’re 
reliable with the

ALL MEN 
Ladies!

BURR
There are so many to deflower.

ALL MEN
Ladies!

BURR
Looks! Proximity to power.  

ALL MEN 
Ladies!

BURR
They delighted and distracted him.
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat 
after him!

HAMILTON
That’s true. 

FULL COMPANY 
1780.

BURR
A winter’s ball
and the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all. 
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you’re rich, son.

HAMILTON 
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one? 

10. HELPLESS

HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS
Hey

ELIZA AND WOMEN 
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m
helpless!
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em.

ELIZA
I have never been the type to try and grab 
the spotlight.
We were at a revel with some rebels on a 
hot night,
laughin’ at my sister as she’s dazzling the 
room
then you walked in and my heart went

“Boom!”
Tryin’ to catch your eye from the side of the 
ballroom,
everybody’s dancin’ and the band’s top 
volume.

ELIZA AND WOMEN
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine.

ELIZA
Grab my sister, and 
whisper, “Yo, this 
one’s mine.” ALL WOMEN

Oooh
My sister made her 
way across the room 
to you Oooh
and I got nervous, 
thinking “What’s she 
gonna do?” Oooh
She grabbed you by 
the arm, I’m thinkin’ 

“I’m through” Oooh
Then you look back at 
me and suddenly I’m
Helpless! Helpless!



Oh, look at those eyes,
Look into your eyes,

Oh! And the sky’s the limit
Yeah, I’m I’m
helpless, I know Helpless!

Down for the count,
And I’m drownin’ 
in ‘em.

I’m so into you, I’m helpless!
I am so into you.

Look into your eyes,
And the sky’s the 
limit I’m
helpless!

I know, I’m down for 
the count
And I’m drownin’ 
in ‘em. Down for the count,

And I’m drownin’ 
in ‘em 

HAMILTON
Where are you taking me?

ANGELICA
I’m about to change your life.

HAMILTON
Then by all means, lead the way.

ELIZA
Elizabeth Schuyler.  It’s a pleasure to meet 
you. 

HAMILTON
Schuyler?

ANGELICA
My sister.

ELIZA
Thank you for all your service.

HAMILTON
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will 
have been worth it.

ANGELICA
I’ll leave you to it.

ELIZA AND WOMEN
One week later

ELIZA
I’m writin’ a letter nightly.
Now my life gets better, every letter that you 
write me.
Laughin’ at my sister, cuz she wants to form 
a harem.

ANGELICA
I’m just sayin’, if you really loved me, you 
would share him.

ELIZA ALL WOMEN
Ha! Two weeks later,
Two weeks later,
In the living room
stressin’, stressin’
my father’s stone-
faced
while you’re asking 
for his
blessin’. blessin’.
I’m dying inside, as 
you wine 
and dine
and I’m tryin’ not to 
cry, ‘cause
there’s nothing that 
your mind can’t do. Oooh
My father makes his 
way across the room 
to you. Oooh
I panic for a second, 
thinking, “we’re 
through” Oooh
But then he shakes 
your hand and says, 

“Be true” Oooh
And you turn back to 
me, smiling, and I’m 

Helpless! Helpless!
Look into your eyes,
and the sky’s the 
limit I’m

Helpless! Helpless!
Hoo! Down for the count,

and I’m drownin’ in 
‘em I’m
helpless!

That boy is mine,
that boy is mine! Look into your eyes,

And the sky’s the

Down for the count, Down for the count,
And I’m drownin’ 
in ‘em 

and I’m drownin’ 
in ‘em

 
helpless!
Down for the count,
and I’m drownin’ 
in ‘em

HAMILTON
Eliza, I don’t have a dollar to my name,
an acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop 
of fame.
All I have’s my honor, a tolerance for pain,
a couple of college credits and my top-notch 
brain.
Insane, your family brings out a different 
side of me,
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take 
a bite of me,
no stress, my love for you is never in doubt.
We’ll get a little place in Harlem and we’ll 
figure it out.
I’ve been livin’ without a family since I was 
a child.
My father left, my mother died, I grew up 
buckwild.
But I’ll never forget my mother’s face, that 
was real,



and long as I’m alive, Eliza, swear to God, 
you’ll never feel so…

ALL WOMEN
ELIZA Helpless!

HAMILTON
I do I do I do 
I do!

Eliza…
Helpless!

I do I do I do 
I do!

I’ve never 
felt so- Helpless!

Hey! Yeah, 
yeah!

Down for the 
count and

I’m 
I’m drownin’ 
in ‘em

Down for the 
count, I’m-

My life is gon’ 
be fine

Helpless!

I look into 
your eyes, Helpless!
and the sky’s 
the limit
I’m

Helpless!
…drownin’ 

in ‘em.
Down for the 
count,
and I’m 
drownin’ in 

‘em.

ALL WOMEN
In New York, you can be a new man…

In New York, you can be a new man…

and the hope 
that
you provide.

You provide!
You provide! You provide!

May you 
always...

HAMILTON 
AND MEN
Always– Always–

be satisfied.         
Rewind– Rewind–

ANGELICA
I remember that night, I just might
regret that night for the rest of my days.

I remember those soldier boys
tripping over themselves to win our praise.

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
like a dream that you can’t quite place,

but Alexander, I’ll never forget the first 
time I saw your face.

I have never been the same,
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame,
And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name,
set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame, 

FULL COMPANY
This is not a game…

HAMILTON
You strike me as a woman who has never been 
satisfied.

ANGELICA
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You 
forget yourself.

HAMILTON
You’re like me. I’m never satisfied.

ANGELICA
Is that right?

HAMILTON
I have never been satisfied.

ANGELICA
My name is Angelica Schuyler.

HAMILTON
Alexander Hamilton.

ANGELICA
Where’s your fam’ly from?



HAMILTON
Unimportant. There’s a million things I 
haven’t done but
just you wait, just you wait…

ANGELICA
So so so—
so this is what it feels like to match wits
with someone at your level! What the hell is 
the catch? It’s
the feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light,
it’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You 
see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe 
three minutes,
ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
a dream and it’s a bit of a dance,
a bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a
bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance.
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his 
answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of 
his pants.

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place,
then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is...

ELIZA
Helpless…

ANGELICA
And I know she is...

ELIZA
Helpless…

ANGELICA
And her eyes are just…

ELIZA
Helpless…

ANGELICA
And I realize

ANGELICA AND COMPANY
Three fundamental truths at the exact same 
time…

HAMILTON
Where are you taking me?

ANGELICA
I’m about to change your life.

HAMILTON
Then by all means, lead the way.

COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)
Number one! 

ANGELICA
I’m a girl in a world in which
my only job is to marry rich.
My father has no sons so I’m the one
who has to social climb for one,
so I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the 
gossip in 
New York City is insidious,
Alexander is penniless,
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less.

ELIZA
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you. 

HAMILTON
Schuyler?

ANGELICA
My sister.

COMPANY
Number two!

ANGELICA
He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister. 
That elevates his status, I’d
have to be naïve to set that aside,
maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza,
now that’s his bride.
Nice going, Angelica, he was right,
You will never be satisfied.

ELIZA
Thank you for all your service.

HAMILTON
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will 
have been worth it.

ANGELICA
I’ll leave you to it.

COMPANY
Number three!

ANGELICA
I know my sister like I know my own mind,
you will never find anyone as trusting or 
as kind.
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently 
resigned,
he’d be mine.
She would say, “I’m fine” 

ANGELICA AND COMPANY
She’d be lying.

ANGELICA
But when I fantasize at night
it’s Alexander’s eyes,
as I romanticize what might 
have been if I hadn’t sized him
up so quickly.
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife;
at least I keep his eyes in my life…

ANGELICA

ALL MEN 
(EXCEPT 
HAMILTON)

12. THE STORY OF 
TONIGHT (REPRISE)

LAURENS
I may not live to see our glory!

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE
I may not live to see our glory!

LAURENS
But I’ve seen wonders great and small.

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE
I’ve seen wonders great and small.

LAURENS
Cuz if the tomcat can get married,

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE
If Alexander can get married—

LAURENS
There’s hope for our ass, after all!

LAFAYETTE
Raise a glass to freedom. 

LAURENS/MULLIGAN
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

MULLIGAN
No matter what she tells you.

LAFAYETTE
Let’s have another round tonight!

LAURENS
Raise a glass to the four of us!

LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON
Ho!

MULLIGAN 
To the newly not poor of us!

LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON
Woo!

LAFAYETTE 
We’ll tell the story of tonight.

LAURENS  
Let’s have another round—

HAMILTON
Well, if it isn’t Aaron Burr.

BURR
Sir!

HAMILTON
I didn’t think that you would make it.

BURR
To be sure.

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE
Burr!

BURR
I came to say congratulations.

MULLIGAN
Spit a verse, Burr!

BURR
I see the whole gang is here. 

LAFAYETTE
You are the worst, Burr!   

HAMILTON
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant 
Colonel.
I wish I had your command instead of 
manning George’s journal.

BURR
No, you don’t.

HAMILTON
Yes, I do.

BURR
Now, be sensible.



From what I hear, you’ve made yourself 
indispensible.

LAURENS
Well, well, I heard
you’ve got a special someone on the side, Burr.

HAMILTON
Is that so?

LAURENS
What are you tryin’ to hide, Burr?

BURR
I should go.

HAMILTON
No, these guys should go.

LAFAYETTE
What?

LAURENS
No!

HAMILTON
Leave us alone.

MULLIGAN
Man…

HAMILTON
It’s alright, Burr. I wish you’d brought this girl 
with you tonight, Burr.

BURR
You’re very kind, but I’m afraid it’s unlawful, 
sir.

HAMILTON
What do you mean?

BURR
She’s married.

HAMILTON
I see.

BURR
She’s married to a British officer.

HAMILTON
Oh shit…

BURR
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more. 
I’ll see you on the other side of the war.

HAMILTON
I will never understand you.
If you love this woman, go get her! What are 
you waiting for?

BURR
I’ll see you on the other side of the war.

HAMILTON
I’ll see you on the other side of the war.

13. WAIT FOR IT

BURR
Theodosia writes me a letter ev’ry day.
I’m keeping her bed warm while her husband 
is away.
He’s on the British side in Georgia. 
He’s tryin’ to keep the colonies in line.
He can keep all of Georgia.
Theodosia, she’s mine.

Love doesn’t discriminate
between the sinners
and the saints,
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep loving anyway.
We laugh and we cry 
and we break
and we make our mistakes.
And if there’s a reason I’m by her side
when so many have tried
then I’m willing to wait for it.
I’m willing to wait for it.

my father

respect.

Respect,

When they

Just a legacy

BURR/ENSEMBLE
Death doesn’t discriminate
between the sinners
and the saints,
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep living anyway.
We rise and we fall 
and we break
and we make our mistakes.
And if there’s a reason I’m still alive
when everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it.
I’m willing to wait for it.

He exhibits no restraint.
He takes and he takes and he takes

He changes the game.
He plays and he raises the stakes.
And if there’s a reason
he seems to thrive when so few survive, then 
Goddamnit-

14. STAY ALIVE

ELIZA
Stay alive...

ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN
Stay alive...

HAMILTON
I have never seen the General so despondent. 
I have taken over writing all his 
correspondence. 
Congress writes, “George, attack the British 
forces.”
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our 
horses. 
Local merchants deny us equipment, 
assistance,  
they only take British money, so sing a song 
of sixpence.



WASHINGTON
The cavalry’s not coming.

HAMILTON 
Sir! 

WASHINGTON
Alex, listen. There’s only one way for us to 
win this. 
Provoke outrage, outright.

HAMILTON
That’s right.

WASHINGTON
Don’t engage, strike by night.
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight.

HAMILTON
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the 
fight. 

WASHINGTON
Outrun. 

HAMILTON
Outrun.

WASHINGTON
Outlast.

HAMILTON
Outlast.

WASHINGTON
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast. 

HAMILTON
Chick-a-plao!

WASHINGTON
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past.
We’re gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast.  

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE
Raise a glass!

MULLIGAN
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship.

LAFAYETTE
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has 
sent a ship.

LAURENS
I stay at work with Hamilton, 
we write essays against slavery,
and every day’s a test of our camaraderie 
and bravery.

HAMILTON
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband, 
we pick and choose our battles and places to 
take a stand.
And ev’ry day,

“Sir, entrust me with a command,”
and ev’ry day, 

WASHINGTON
No.

HAMILTON
He dismisses me out of hand. 

HAMILTON
ELIZA/
ANGELICA 

Instead of me, Stay alive…
he promotes LEE
Charles Lee. Charles Lee.
Makes him
second-in-
command:

LEE
I’m a General. Whee!!!!

HAMILTON
Yeah. He’s not the choice I would have gone 
with. 

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth.

WASHINGTON
Ev’ryone attack!

LEE
Retreat!

WASHINGTON
Attack!

LEE
Retreat!

WASHINGTON
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your 
feet! 

LEE
But there’s so many of them! 

WASHINGTON
I’m sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

HAMILTON
Ready, sir!

WASHINGTON
Have Lafayette take the lead!

HAMILTON
Yes, sir!

LAURENS
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree 
heat.

LAFAYETTE
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of 
defeat.

HAMILTON 
Charles Lee was left behind
without a pot to piss in.
He started sayin’ this to anybody who would 
listen:

LEE
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices



indecisive, from crisis to crisis.
The best thing he can do for the revolution 
is turn n’
go back to plantin’ tobacco in Mount Vernon.

COMPANY
Oo!!

WASHINGTON
Don’t do a thing. History will prove him wrong. 

HAMILTON
But, sir!

WASHINGTON
We have a war to fight, let’s move along.

LAURENS
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold 
him to it.

HAMILTON
I can’t disobey direct orders.

LAURENS
Then I’ll do it.
Alexander, you’re the closest friend I’ve got.

HAMILTON 
Laurens, do not throw away your shot.

15. TEN DUEL 
COMMANDMENTS

MEN
One, two, three, four

FULL COMPANY
Five, six, seven, eight, nine…

BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE
It’s the Ten Duel Commandments.

FULL COMPANY 
It’s the Ten Duel Commandments.

Number one!

LAURENS
The challenge: demand satisfaction.
If they apologize, no need for further action.

COMPANY
Number two!

LAURENS
If they don’t, grab a friend, that’s your second.

HAMILTON
Your lieutenant when there’s reckoning to 
be reckoned.

COMPANY
Number three!

LEE 
Have your seconds meet face to face.

BURR
Negotiate a peace…

HAMILTON
Or negotiate a time and place. 

BURR 
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween 
recruits.

COMPANY
Most disputes die, and no one shoots. 
Number four!

LAURENS
If they don’t reach a peace, that’s alright.
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site.

HAMILTON
You pay him in advance, you treat him with 
civility.

BURR 
You have him turn around so he can have 
deniability.

COMPANY
Five!

LEE  
Duel before the sun is in the sky.

COMPANY
Pick a place to die where it’s high and dry, 
number six!

HAMILTON
Leave a note for your next of kin.
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or 
heaven lets you in.

COMPANY
Seven!

LEE 
Confess your sins, ready for the moment
of adrenaline when you finally face your 
opponent.

COMPANY
Number eight!

LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR 
Your last chance to negotiate.
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the 
record straight…

BURR
Alexander.

HAMILTON
Aaron Burr, sir.

BURR
Can we agree that duels are dumb and 
immature?

HAMILTON
Sure.
But your man has to answer for his words, 
Burr.

BURR
With his life? We both know that’s absurd, sir.



HAMILTON
Hang on, how many men died because Lee 
was inexperienced and ruinous?

BURR
Okay, so we’re doin’ this.

COMPANY  
Number nine!

HAMILTON  
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher.
Summon all the courage you require. 
Then count

MEN
One two three four 

FULL COMPANY
Five six seven eight nine

HAMILTON/BURR
Number

COMPANY
Ten paces!

HAMILTON/BURR
Fire!

16. MEET ME INSIDE

HAMILTON
Lee, do you yield?

BURR 
You shot him in the side!  
Yes, he yields! 

LAURENS
I’m satisfied.

BURR 
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

HAMILTON
Go! We won. 

COMPANY
Here comes the General!

BURR
This should be fun.

WASHINGTON
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr,
get a medic for the General.

BURR
Yes, sir.

WASHINGTON
Lee, you will never agree with me,
but believe me, these young men don’t speak 
for me.
Thank you for your service.

BURR
Let’s ride!

WASHINGTON
Hamilton!

HAMILTON
Sir!

WASHINGTON
Meet me inside.

COMPANY 
Meet him inside! Meet him inside! Meet him 
inside, meet him, meet him inside!

WASHINGTON
Son—

HAMILTON
Don’t call me son.

WASHINGTON
This war is hard enough
without infighting—

HAMILTON
Lee called you out. We called his bluff.

WASHINGTON
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies 
to the south.

HAMILTON
You’re absolutely right. John should have shot 
him in the mouth.
That would’ve shut him up.

WASHINGTON
Son—

HAMILTON
I’m notcha son—

WASHINGTON
Watch your tone.
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I 
am grown.

HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway, 
these men take your name and they rake it
through the mud.

WASHINGTON
My name’s been through a lot, I can take it.

HAMILTON
Well, I don’t have your name. I don’t have 
your titles. 
I don’t have your land.
But, if you—

WASHINGTON
No—

HAMILTON
If you gave me command of a battalion, a 
group of men to lead, I could fly above my 
station after the war.

WASHINGTON
Or you could die and we need you alive.

HAMILTON
I’m more than willing to die—



WASHINGTON
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you 
alive—

HAMILTON
Call me son one more time—

WASHINGTON
Go home, Alexander.
That’s an order from your commander.

HAMILTON
Sir—

WASHINGTON
Go home.

17. THAT WOULD  
BE ENOUGH

ELIZA
Look around, look around at how lucky we are 
to be alive right now.
Look around, look around…

HAMILTON
How long have you known?

ELIZA
A month or so.

HAMILTON
Eliza, you should have told me.

ELIZA
I wrote to the General a month ago.

HAMILTON
No.

ELIZA
I begged him to send you home.

HAMILTON
You should have told me.

ELIZA
I’m not sorry.

 ELIZA HAMILTON
I knew you’d fight 
until the war was won

The war’s not 

done.
But you deserve a 
chance to meet
your son.
Look around, look 
around
at how lucky we are 
to be alive 
right now.

HAMILTON
Will you relish being a poor man’s wife,
unable to provide for your life?

ELIZA
I relish being your wife.
Look around, look around…

Look at where you are.
Look at where you started.
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle.
Just stay alive, that would be enough.

And if this child

Shares a fraction of your smile
or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough.

I don’t pretend to know
the challenges you’re facing.
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in 
your mind.

But I’m not afraid.
I know who I married.
So long as you come home at the end of 
the day
that would be enough.

We don’t need a legacy.
We don’t need money.
If I could grant you peace of mind,

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
in the story they will write someday.
Let this moment be the first chapter:
where you decide to stay
and I could be enough  
and we could be enough  
that would be enough.  

18. GUNS AND SHIPS

BURR
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need 
of a shower
somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the 
quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross’ flag 
higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who’s 
unafraid to step in!
He’s constantly confusin’, confoundin’ the 
British henchmen.
Ev’ryone give it up for America’s favorite 
fighting Frenchman!

COMPANY
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE
I’m takin this horse by the reins makin’ 
redcoats redder with bloodstains.

COMPANY
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE
And I’m never gonna stop until I make ‘em 
drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their 
remains, I’m-



COMPANY
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE
Watch me engagin’ em! Escapin’ em!  
Enragin’ em! I’m-

COMPANY
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE
I go to France for more funds.

COMPANY
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE
I come back with more

LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE 
Guns 
And ships
And so the balance shifts.

WASHINGTON
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate 
their gifts.

LAFAYETTE
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them 
off at sea, but
for this to succeed, there’s someone else 
we need:

WASHINGTON
I know.

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench. 
ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean—

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE
Sir, you’re gonna have to use him eventually,
what’s he gonna do on the bench? I mean—

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY 
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE 
No one has more resilience
or matches my practical tactical brilliance—

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE
You wanna 
fight for your 
land back?

COMPANY
Hamilton!

WASHINGTON
I need my 
right hand 
man back!

WOMEN 
LAFAYETTE Hamilton! MEN
Ah! Uh, get 
ya right hand 
man back

Get your right 
hand man 
back! 

you know you 
gotta get ya 
right hand 
man back

Hamilton! Your right 
hand man 
back!

I mean you 
gotta put 
some thought 
into the 
letter but the 
sooner

Hamilton! Hamilton!
Ha-
Ha-

the better to 
get your right 
hand man 
back!

Hamilton, 
Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

Hamilton, 
Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

WASHINGTON
Alexander Hamilton,
troops are waiting in the field for you.
If you join us right now, together we can turn 
the tide.
Oh, Alexander Hamilton,
I have soldiers who will yield for you.
If we manage to get this right,
they’ll surrender by early light.
The world will never be the same, Alexander…

19. HISTORY HAS  
ITS EYES ON YOU

WASHINGTON
I was younger then you are now
when I was given my first command.
I led my men straight into a massacre.
I witnessed their deaths firsthand.

I made every mistake,
I felt the shame rise in me,
And even now I lie awake, 

WASHINGTON
LAURENS/
MULLIGAN

Knowing history has 
its eyes

Whoa…

on me. Whoa…
Whoa…
Yeah

HAMILTON/
WASHINGTON
History has its COMPANY
eyes on Whoa…
me. Whoa….

Whoa…
Yeah

WASHINGTON
Let me tell you what I wish I’d known
when I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:



WASHINGTON AND COMPANY 
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story.

WASHINGTON
I know that we can win.
I know that greatness lies in you.
But remember from here on in,

WASHINGTON/
HAMILTON AND 
MEN
History has its

ENSEMBLE
Eyes on you. Whoa…

Whoa…
Whoa…

FULL COMPANY
History has its eyes on you.

20. YORKTOWN  
(THE WORLD TURNED 
UPSIDE DOWN)

COMPANY 
The battle of Yorktown. 1781.

LAFAYETTE
Monsieur Hamilton.

HAMILTON
Monsieur Lafayette.

LAFAYETTE
In command where you belong.

HAMILTON 
How you say, no sweat.
Finally on the field. We’ve had quite a run.

LAFAYETTE
Immigrants:

HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE
We get the job done.

HAMILTON
So what happens if we win?

LAFAYETTE
I go back to France,
I bring freedom to my people if I’m given 
the chance.

HAMILTON
We’ll be with you when you do.

LAFAYETTE
Go lead your men.

HAMILTON
See you on the other side.

LAFAYETTE
‘Til we meet again, let’s go!

ENSEMBLE 
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
Hey yo, I’m just like my country, I’m young, 
scrappy and hungry
and I’m not throwin’ away my shot!

I am not throwin’ away my shot!

HAMILTON
‘Til the world turns upside down...

ENSEMBLE
‘Til the world turns upside down!

HAMILTON
I imagine death so much it feels more like 
a memory.
This is where it gets me:
on my feet,
the enemy ahead of me.
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend 
with me,
weapon in my hand, a command, and my 
men with me.
Then I remember my Eliza’s expecting me...
not only that, my Eliza’s expecting.

We gotta go, gotta get the job done,
gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

ENSEMBLE
What?

HAMILTON
The bullets out your gun!

ENSEMBLE
What?

HAMILTON
We move under cover and we move as one
through the night, we have one shot to live 
another day.
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away.
We will fight up close, seize the moment and 
stay in it.
It’s either that or meet the business end of 
a bayonet. 
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,’ dig me?

ENSEMBLE
Rochambeau!

HAMILTON
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
with my friends all scattered to the winds.
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining 
brav’ry.

HAMILTON/LAURENS
We’ll never be free until we end slavery!

HAMILTON
When we finally drive the British away,
Lafayette is there waiting—

HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE
In Chesapeake Bay!

HAMILTON
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That’s right,



HAMILTON/COMPANY
Hercules Mulligan!

MULLIGAN
A tailor spyin’ on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and 
then I smuggle it!

COMPANY
Up

MULLIGAN
To my brother’s revolutionary covenant
I’m runnin’ with the Sons of Liberty and I am 
lovin’ it!
See, that’s what happens when you up against 
the ruffians.
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction,
when you knock me down I get the fuck back 
up again!

COMPANY
Left! Right! Hold! 
Go!
What! What! What! 

HAMILTON
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red 
coat stands on a parapet.

LAFAYETTE
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a 
white handkerchief. 

MULLIGAN
And just like that, it’s over. We tend to our 
wounded, we count our dead.  

LAURENS
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this 
really means freedom.

WASHINGTON
Not. Yet.

HAMILTON
We negotiate the terms of surrender.
I see George Washington smile.
We escort their men out of Yorktown.
They stagger home single file.
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets. 
There are screams and church bells ringing. 

And as our fallen foes retreat,
I hear the drinking song they’re singing…

ALL MEN
The world turned upside down.

FULL COMPANY 
The world turned upside down,
the world turned upside down, 
the world turned upside down, 
down,
down, down, down.

LAFAYETTE
Freedom for America, freedom for France! 

COMPANY 
Down, down, down.

HAMILTON
Gotta start a new nation,
gotta meet my son.

COMPANY 
Down, down, down.

MULLIGAN 
We won!

LAFAYETTE
We won! 

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS
We won! 

MULL/LAF/LAUR/HAMILTON/
WASHINGTON
We won!

COMPANY 
The world turned upside down!

21. WHAT COMES 
NEXT?

KING GEORGE
They say
the price of my war’s not a price that they’re 
willing to pay.
Insane.
You cheat with the French, now I’m fighting 
with France and with Spain.
I’m so blue.
I thought that we’d made an arrangement 
when you went away, 
You were mine to subdue.
Well, even despite our estrangement, I’ve got 
a small query for you:

What comes next?
You’ve been freed.
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You’re on your own.
Awesome. Wow.
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise.
Empires fall.
It’s much harder when it’s all your call.

All alone, across the sea.
When your people say they hate you, don’t 
come crawling back to me.

Da da da dat da dat da da da 
Da ya da 
Da da dat 
Da da ya da. . .

You’re on your own . . .



22. DEAR THEODOSIA

BURR
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother’s 
name.

When you came into the world, you cried and 
it broke my heart.

I’m dedicating every day to you.
Domestic life was never quite my style.
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart.
And I thought I was so smart.

You will come of age with our young nation.
We’ll bleed and fight for you, we’ll make it 
right for you.
If we lay a strong enough foundation
we’ll pass it on to you, we’ll give the world to 
you, and you’ll blow us all away… 
someday, someday.
Yeah, you’ll blow us all away,  
someday, someday.

HAMILTON
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone.
My son.
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I’m 
looking for.
There is so much more inside me now.

Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun.
My son.
When you smile, I fall apart.
And I thought I was so smart.
My father wasn’t around. 

BURR
My father wasn’t around.

Burr, that’s why we need it.

BURR
The constitution’s a mess.

HAMILTON
So it needs amendments. 

BURR
It’s full of contradictions.

HAMILTON
So is independence. 
We have to start somewhere.

BURR
No. No way.

You’re making a mistake.

BURR
Good night.

Hey.

What do you stall for?

Do you support this constitution?

BURR
Of course.

BURR
Alexander joins forces with James Madison 
and John Jay to write a series of essays 
defending the new United States Constitution, 
entitled The Federalist Papers.
The plan was to write a total of twenty-five 
essays, the work divided evenly among the 
three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five 
essays, in the span of six months. John Jay 
got sick after writing five. James Madison 
wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other 
fifty-one.
