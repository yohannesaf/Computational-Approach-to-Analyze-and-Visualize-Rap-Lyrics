Now who's that kickin in the K for the West?
Shade pop with the flows that seep hoes in your vest
Half nigga with the word
Half run up in your spot to talk shit
Where I'm from, we prone to lick shots
Now Dogg Pound Gangstas but me up on game (up on game)
Now that I'm here a lot of shit gonna change
Mister quick to buy a chain, mister let the chain hang
Showin off the broads
I'm mister quick to get to bang
Now you might catch Sheist gettin bent in every coast
Still the nigga with the heat gettin rid of every coastp
Still fuckin with Mizz, we run trizz when we bored
And you know I got the X, twenties what they hittin for
See me if you want to score, 'cause I got what you need
